This is a modified version of the Unity-Technologies UI module which allows the use of multiple concurrent eventsystems in your project. 

### How do I get started? ###
+ A folder exists in the root directory called "Output", the generated dll's will output here in the correct folder structure
    * If you wish to use these dll's
    * Locate your Unity install location
    * Windows: Copy the contents of Output folder to: `Data\UnityExtensions\Unity\GUISystem\{UNITY_VERSION}`
    * OSX: Copy the contents of Output folder to: `Unity.app/Contents/UnityExtensions/Unity/GUISystem/{UNITY_VERSION}`

### Update frequency and version updates? ###
The current commit (6th March 2016) applies to Unity version 5.3.3p2 and some of the fixes applied to the main Unity repository.

I skipped version 5.2 code as I missed to commit the sources on that and only have prebuilt libraries left (which I will add to the "Downloads" section in the next days)
